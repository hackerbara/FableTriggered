# HarnessMonkey Launch Runbook

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** approved design, execution in progress
**Goal:** Ship this project publicly as **harnessmonkey** (one word, everywhere) — a fresh repo at `github.com/hackerbara/harnessmonkey`, single clean commit, 9 packages locked to the latest Claude Code version, on the unified package-model schema. This repo (`Claude-patch` / FableTriggered) stays as the private historical dev archive; the cutover happens by copying into a clean new folder at the rename step.

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| Project name | `harnessmonkey` — dist name, Python import, CLI command, `~/.harnessmonkey` state dir, "HarnessMonkey" display form |
| Install story | clone + `uv sync` + `uv run harnessmonkey …` (source-first). PyPI holds a name-claim stub only (`0.0.1`), no release discipline for v1 |
| Manifest schema | Package-model format (`package_model.py`), `schemaVersion: 1`, `kind` **required**. This is "v1" of the public format. Flat-v2 files and the legacy loader never existed publicly |
| Repo contents | Ship everything real: `src/`, `packages/` (final 9), `examples/` (art generators), `tests/`, `assets/` (**filtered** — see 2.1), `HarnessMonkey-README.md` **ships as `README.md`**, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`. Exclude dev process: `docs/superpowers/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDEMONKEY.md`, old `README.md` (FableTriggered), `.development/`, egg-info, root patch-instruction notes (`claude-fable-fallback-patch.md`, `claude-reminder-suppression-patch.md`), and `assets/fabletriggered-screenshot.jpeg` (**leaks an unrelated private project's `/resume` screen — must not ship**) |
| Cutover mechanism | Clean new folder; copy ship-set in; rename there; `git init`; single commit; push to new repo |

### Final package set and names (signed off)

| Ships as | Was | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `capybara-onsen` | (same) | art patch; generator ships in `examples/` |
| `heraldic-dragons` | `hotrod-dragons` | art patch; generator ships in `examples/` |
| `fable-fallback` | (same) | the origin story |
| `hidden-context-drawer` | (same) | depends on drawer-dock |
| `hidden-context-inline` | `normal-channel-hidden-context` | conflicts with hidden-context-drawer |
| `reminders-drawer` | `reminders-manager` | depends on drawer-dock; conflicts with mute-reminders |
| `mute-reminders` | `upstream-attachment-suppression` | static suppression of the 7 attachment families |
| `thinking-drawer` | `thinking-text-drawer` | depends on drawer-dock |
| `drawer-dock` | `footer-drawers` | shared drawer framework (lands via G1) |

**Cut (never ship):** `dvd-cursor-goblin`, `dvd-cursor-real-art-spike`, `dvd-cursor-terminal-art-spike` (+ their 3 test files), `reminder-suppression` (superseded 2.1.198 predecessor of mute-reminders).

## Gates (in flight, user-driven)

- [ ] **G1 — footer-drawers lands.** `codex/footer-drawers-framework` is a clean 10-commit fast-forward of main (merge-base = main's tip `3364d04`). Merge when the user's in-flight work completes.
- [ ] **G2 — GUI rework lands.** `codex/claude-monkey-v3-gui` (canonical; `-sr1`/`-t16`/`-t17` are confirmed strict-subset earlier iterations). 41 commits behind main → **must rebase onto main after G1**, then land. Its `packages/` copies are stale — take main's/G1's for every package. **The branch is a full menubar replacement, not an addition** — its deletions and pyproject changes are intentional and must survive the rebase: deletes `src/claude_monkey/menubar.py` (rumps retired), repoints the menubar console script to `claude_monkey.gui.app:main`, swaps the `gui` extra from `rumps` to `PySide6>=6.7` (+ `pytest-qt`, `Pillow` dev deps), deletes `assets/claude-monkey-menubar-template.png`, adds `monkey-color-*.png` / `monkey-tray-*.png` assets (these ship).
- [ ] **G3 — demo recorder tool ready.** In flight per `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-04-demo-recorder.md`. Independent of G1/G2; only blocks Phase 3 recording.

## Phase 1 — Content & cuts (after G1 + G2; old repo; system stays green after each step)

- [ ] 1.1 Delete the 4 cut packages + `tests/test_dvd_cursor_*.py`, **and in the same change** remove `reminder-suppression` from `tests/test_reference_packages.py` `PACKAGE_DIRS` (it hardcodes the cut package's path — the suite fails otherwise); run full test suite.
- [ ] 1.2 Delete the dead legacy loader path (`src/claude_monkey/manifest.py`, `builder.py`, and their orphaned helpers/tests — verify unreachable from `cli.py` first; survey says only tests import them).
- [ ] 1.3 Create `examples/` with curated generators: `.development/capy-onsen-20260703/` and `.development/highdef-v11-20260702/` pipelines (paint/sim/compile/generate_package + a short README each). Scope `.gitignore` accordingly. Generators are *examples*, not build inputs — packages remain standalone artifacts.
- [ ] 1.4 **Schema unification:** make package-model the only public format — `kind` required; remove the `schemaVersion:1`-without-`kind` compat dispatch (`builder_v15.py:103-105`); fix the lossy v3→internal conversion (hardcoded `packageVersion "0.0.0"`, `builder_v15.py:85`); migrate all 9 manifests; extend `tests/test_reference_packages.py` to cover all 9 (it currently checks a stale list of 5).
- [ ] 1.5 **Re-pin all 9 packages to the latest Claude Code binary** — determine latest at execution time (do not assume 2.1.201); re-verify each patch against it; fix `normal-channel-hidden-context`'s dual-pin (2.1.198 + 2.1.199 in one manifest). This is per-package verification work, potentially re-authoring ops that no longer anchor.
- [ ] 1.6 Parameterize `/Users/MAC` paths in the ~8 remaining test files after 1.1 (env var or discovery helper with the current paths as fallback).
- [ ] 1.7 **Package doc scrub:** rewrite the "Build pipeline" sections in `capybara-onsen`, `hotrod-dragons`, `hidden-context-drawer`, `reminders-manager` READMEs — they currently give `cd /Users/MAC/Documents/Claude-patch` + `.development/` rebuild commands that are dead in the public repo; point them at `examples/` instead. Remove cut-package cross-references from surviving docs: the "Why this supersedes reminder-suppression" section in `upstream-attachment-suppression/README.md:44-46`, the compat mention in `hidden-context-drawer/README.md:22`, and the `reminder-suppression` fixture strings in `tests/test_config_v3.py:28,41`.

## Phase 2 — Cutover & rename (new clean folder)

- [ ] 2.1 Create the clean folder (e.g. `~/Documents/harnessmonkey`); copy ship-set per the repo-contents table. Explicit copy manifest, reviewed before proceeding.
- [ ] 2.2 Project rename in the new tree — **grep-driven, not file-list-driven**: the old name appears in 20+ ship-set files beyond the obvious ones. Anchor points: `pyproject.toml` (`name = "harnessmonkey"`, scripts `harnessmonkey` / `harnessmonkey-gui` — the old script name says "menubar" but post-G2 it launches a Qt app; veto if `-menubar` preferred); `src/claude_monkey/` → `src/harnessmonkey/` + all imports; `~/.claude-monkey` → `~/.harnessmonkey`; `OWNER_MARKER` in `install.py:14` **and its unlinked duplicate literal in `source_discovery.py:78`** (make the latter import the constant); the GUI package's own branding (`settings_window.py` window title, `tray.py` label, `gui/app.py` single-instance key, already-running message, state-dir literals, and the **`python -m claude_monkey` subprocess invocation that hard-breaks post-rename**, `window_model.py` state-dir literals); **~18 test files that assert on the literal strings** (`test_cli.py:21`, `test_authorization.py:38`, `test_cli_json_contracts.py` owner fields, etc. — the rename is done when `rg -i 'claude.?monkey'` over the new tree returns zero). Fresh `uv sync` regenerates `uv.lock` under the new name; egg-info gitignored.
- [ ] 2.3 Package renames per table: directory names, `patch.json` ids/labels, payload refs, `requiresPackages`/`conflictsWithPackages` cross-refs, per-package test files and READMEs.
- [ ] 2.4 Full test suite green in the new tree; `uv run harnessmonkey doctor` works.
- [ ] 2.5 Add MIT `LICENSE` (copyright holder: hackerbara) and a `license` field in `pyproject.toml`.

## Phase 3 — README & demos (after Phase 2 + G3)

- [ ] 3.1 Finalize README (becomes `README.md`): fill install TKs with the real clone+uv journey (requirements: macOS Apple Silicon + uv; verify whether Xcode CLT is actually needed before claiming); **document the GUI install explicitly** — `uv sync --extra gui` pulls PySide6, a heavy non-default dependency, and the README's "Click Install from the menubar or GUI page" flow depends on it; system-prompt link → https://github.com/hackerbara/lessanxious-claude/tree/main; clone URL → `github.com/hackerbara/harnessmonkey`.
- [ ] 3.2 Rebuild the package table: 9 rows, final names, one line each, `assets/demos/<final-name>.gif` per row.
- [ ] 3.3 Record demos with the G3 recorder: 9 package GIFs + header GIF (`capyclaude.gif`); copy reviewed output into `assets/demos/`; verify every README image resolves.
- [ ] 3.4 Sweep for remaining TKs; anything Claude can't fill gets flagged to the user explicitly.

## Phase 4 — Publish

- [ ] 4.1 PyPI: **stubs built and ready** at `.development/pypi-stub/{harnessmonkey,harness-monkey}/dist/` (0.0.1, MIT, pointing at the GitHub repo). User has the account; publish with an API token: `cd .development/pypi-stub/harnessmonkey && uv publish --token <pypi-token>` (repeat in `harness-monkey/` for the pointer claim). Names verified free on PyPI 2026-07-04.
- [ ] 4.2 Final hygiene sweep in the new tree: zero `/Users/MAC` hits, zero secrets/emails, no dev-doc leakage, `.gitignore` correct, LICENSE present (see open questions).
- [ ] 4.2a **PII scan (hard gate):** mechanical case-insensitive scan of the entire fresh repo (tracked files *and* full new git history) for `alex` and `bernson` — zero hits required before push. These stay strictly in the local historical repo. Include word-boundary-free match (catches emails/handles); manually review any hit before deciding it's a false positive. Known false positive as of 2026-07-04: the minified identifier `apiRefusalExplanation` (contains "alEx") in `packages/fable-fallback/payloads/gcm-assistant-case.js` — scanned today, zero true hits in the ship set, zero `bernson` hits anywhere. **Text scan cannot inspect images** — additionally eyeball every shipped image (`assets/`, `packages/*/preview.png`, all GIFs) for leaked screen content before push; this is how the `fabletriggered-screenshot.jpeg` leak was caught.
- [ ] 4.3 User creates `github.com/hackerbara/harnessmonkey`; `git init`, single commit, push.
- [ ] 4.4 **Proof:** fresh clone in a temp dir → full install journey (`uv sync` → `doctor` → enable a patch → `build --activate` → `install-shim` → launch) → full test suite → README renders with all images on GitHub.

## Risks

- **Re-pin scope unknown (1.5):** if the latest Claude Code binary moved significantly past 2.1.201, some patches may need op re-authoring, not just pin bumps. Budget for it; it's the least mechanical task here.
- **GUI rebase (G2):** 94 files, 41 commits behind; the rebase is the highest-conflict moment. Do it immediately after G1, before anything else moves.
- **Copy-manifest omissions (2.1):** a clean-folder cutover fails *silently* by leaving something behind (a payload dir, a test fixture). Mitigated by 2.4 full-suite + 4.4 fresh-clone proof.
- **GIF weight:** 10 GIFs of terminal recordings can get heavy for a repo clone; review sizes at 3.3, consider palette/fps tuning before committing.

## Non-goals

- Real PyPI releases / Trusted Publishing (post-launch)
- Auto-tracking new Claude Code versions (design is fail-closed by intent; README says so honestly)
- Cross-platform support (macOS arm64 only, stated)
- Prompt/option packages in the launch set (the schema supports them; v1 ships 9 patches)

## Open questions

*(none — resolved 2026-07-04)*

1. ~~LICENSE~~ → **MIT** (user decision). Added as task 2.5.
2. ~~Header GIF~~ → **capy-onsen scene** (`capyclaude.gif`), confirmed.

## State of play — handoff for a fresh-context session

*Last updated 2026-07-04, session 1. A fresh agent should read this runbook top to bottom, then this section, then check `git log --oneline -15` and the task states below before doing anything.*

**Done:**
- All design decisions locked (tables above are signed off by the user — do not re-litigate names, schema, or repo contents).
- Adversarial review folded in (commit `0331f76`); the G2 gate description, 2.2 rename scope, and PII gate reflect its findings.
- PyPI stubs built (see 4.1) — awaiting user's API token to publish. Names verified free.
- PII scan baseline: zero true `alex`/`bernson` hits in ship set (known false positive documented in 4.2a).

**In flight (sub-agents dispatched 2026-07-04, check `git log` for their commits):**
- 1.3 examples/ curation — agent copying + scrubbing the capy/dragons generator pipelines from `.development/` into `examples/*-generator/`.
- 1.6 test-path parameterization — agent replacing `/Users/MAC` literals with an env-var + home-relative discovery helper; dvd test files deliberately skipped (they're cut in 1.1).
- G1 (footer-drawers), G3 (demo recorder) — **user's own in-flight work**, not agent tasks. Do not start G2 (GUI rebase) until the user lands G1.

**Next actions when resuming:**
1. Verify the two sub-agent commits landed and tests are green (`uv run pytest`).
2. Ask the user about G1/G3 status. When G1 lands → immediately do the G2 rebase (highest-conflict step; instructions in the G2 gate above).
3. After G1+G2: Phase 1 tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7 in order.
4. Remaining user-only items: PyPI token (4.1), creating `github.com/hackerbara/harnessmonkey` (4.3), G1/G3 completion.

## Research appendix

Findings from three survey agents, 2026-07-04 (full reports in session transcript): package inventory & generator locations; launch-script/entry-point map, version-pin census (2.1.198–2.1.201 spread), schema-family analysis (`manifest.py` legacy / `manifest_v2.py` / `package_model.py`, dispatch at `builder_v15.py:92-107`); worktree audit — 12 worktrees, GUI-branch canonicality (`v3-gui` ⊃ `sr1`/`t16`/`t17`), footer-drawers = clean FF at `3364d04`, main canonical for all packages except the drawer family, `/Users/MAC` footprint (551 hits, ~500 in dev docs), no secrets/emails found.
